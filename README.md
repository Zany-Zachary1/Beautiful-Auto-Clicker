# Beautiful-Auto-Clicker
The repo for the most Beautiful Auto Clicker.
# The Purpose

The purpose of this was because all of the other auto clickers on the internet just didn't have that *style*, ya know?  So I decided to create my own.

# Installation

Just download, extract, and double-click the `.exe` file.  That's it! Done!

# Credits

Thanks to my Foundations of Programming teacher Mr. Pawly for pointing me to PyInstaller, which is what this was compiled with.
